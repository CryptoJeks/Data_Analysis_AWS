A common customer question that echoes in their retail outlets is the impact on price because of changes in some aspects of the ornament. For example, usually customers ask: \"If I decreased the carat of the diamonds used in this design, by how much would the price reduce?\". Such queries often require an expert intervention on the shopfloor and result in a subdued customer experience. The company also wants to implement a price predictor tool on their website so customers can engage with the brand better. At the moment, no such tool exists and the business team estimates that a price predictor will improve traffic to the website and also improve the time spent on the website.\n",

It allows developers to interact with these storage systems using a common set of methods and handles various functionalities like reading, writing, and managing files.\n",

    "When it comes to AWS and Azure, both cloud providers offer their own file storage services. AWS provides Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Azure offers Azure Blob Storage. These services are object storage solutions that allow you to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data.\n",

    "With `fsspec`, you can interact with AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage using a consistent API, regardless of the underlying implementation details. This means that you can write code that works with both AWS and Azure storage systems without having to change the code for each provider (e.g., `pd.read_csv` that takes S3 location *or* Azure blob store location as the input).\n",
    "\n",
    "`fsspec` provides a set of core classes and functions that define the interface for file operations. It supports features like file listing, reading and writing files, handling directories, and metadata operations. By utilizing fsspec, developers can seamlessly switch between different storage systems without rewriting their code.\n",
    "\n",

[Caveat: current version of `s3fs` is pinned to a previous version of AWS dependencies](https://github.com/fsspec/s3fs/issues/528).

    "Up until now, we have focused on data files already residing in the cloud (S3 or Azure Blob Storage). But how does the data initially make its way into the data store? While the responsibility of handling data ingress from external sources into the cloud lies with data engineers, it's beneficial to view blob stores as services that can be leveraged by other services to upload data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three examples of how data from external sources can be stored in cloud stores:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Extraction from Relational Databases: Suppose there is a scenario where transactions from an on-premise relational database need to be stored in AWS S3. In this case, a data extraction process can be implemented to query the database, summarize the relevant data, and then push it to an S3 bucket. This ensures that the transaction data is securely stored in the cloud for further analysis or archival purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Real-time Data Streaming: Imagine a situation where a company collects real-time data from various sources, such as IoT devices or social media feeds, and wants to store it in Azure Blob Storage. In this scenario, a data streaming pipeline can be set up using technologies like Apache Kafka or Azure Event Hubs. The streaming pipeline continuously captures the incoming data, transforms it if necessary, and then stores it in Azure Blob Storage for immediate or later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Web Scraping and Data Ingestion: Web scraping is a common technique used to extract data from websites. Let's say there is a requirement to gather data from multiple websites and store it in AWS S3. To achieve this, a web scraping script can be developed using tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. The script can crawl the targeted websites, extract the desired information, and finally push the scraped data to AWS S3, making it readily accessible for analysis or other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, data from external sources is processed or extracted and then stored in cloud storage services like AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage. These cloud stores offer scalability, durability, and accessibility, enabling efficient data storage and subsequent utilization in various cloud-based applications."
